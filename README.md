# **Milestone Project 1**



## **CC Fitness.** 
The aim of the website is to advertise CC Fitness to prospective clients and to sell the company in the local area.  It is arranged in 4 different pages using links in the header.



## **UX**

The site is for anyone who is interested in employing a personal trainer and to show the variety of exercises that are available to anyone and everyone. 
It shows a few testimonials the company have received from current clients and the various goals each person is able to achieve. 
There is also video evidence of some of the activities that you can expect to experience. 
There is also a short biog of the trainer giving his qualifications and experience.
Finally, there will be an activity list with prices including a discount price for booking 10 sessions in advance.
 
The main purposes for the site are showing all the things I would want to know if I were to be a customer and was looking for a personal trainer on my area. 
I would need to know where they are based, what they have to offer, their experience, testimonials from current clients and finally the courses available and costs. 


## **Features**

Each page tells a different story. 

- *Home Page:* Shows a strong headline with a mission statement. This is meant to draw the user in. there is a backdrop of a park with a runner which will show that this is an activity 
               that can be performed outdoors as well as in a gym. There is also a list of testimonials given by current clients. 

- *Videos:* This page will have a number of videos showing the sort of exercise that is available and will cover the different types of age and experience the trainer will cover. 

- *About:* A short description showing the experience and qualifications of the trainer. It will also show his enthusiasm and dedication. 

- *Prices:* The final page will show the available sessions and the prices per hour for each class. This includes a discount for long term booking.

- *Sign up:* Each page has a Sign Up button which points to a Modal asking for a Name, e-mail address and which type of course the user is interested in. 
             When the site is up and running this will be linked to the company e-mail ready to be answered. Each section is set up with a required field so the customer must fill in all details correctly. 
             The Name and email boxes are set up as "required" so the client has to fill these out correctly or a fault message will appear. The third box to fill out has a dropdown box showing the options to classes you would be interested in.


## **Features Left to Implement**

As this is a test site currently and not due to go live for some time, there are still some areas to be completed. 

There are currently no links set up for the social media

There is no e-mail address attached to the submit button of the modal to Sign Up.



## **Technologies Used**

- *Wireframe:* The initial template for the site was built on a wireframe using Balsamiq. This template was changed as the project progressed, but the basics are the same.

- *HTML:* The Project used HTML as its main language for the website

- *CSS:* CSS was used for styling the HTML part of the project.

- *Bootstrap:* Much of the project was styled using Bootstrap.

- *Font Awesome 5:* The social media icons and company logo were displayed using Font Awesome




## **Testing**

During the project various components were tested, where required. 

- *Navigation Bar:* The Navbar was tested to ensure the user was able to move between pages as required.

- *Videos:* I tested the videos to make sure the opened quickly enough and correctly, then I ran each one to make sure they would start and stop using the controls. I ran all the videos at the same time to ensure they didn't judder or freeze. All the videos were set up to work on a loop once they were activated. This was tested after every video was installed and resized and tested on all screen sizes.

- *Sign Up Button:* The sign up button was tested on every page and made sure that all the entries were required to be filled out and an error message appears if they are not. There is also a dropdown section within the sign up showing the different courses available and which one the client is interested in. This was tested on every page to ensure it was the same across the site. 

- *Sizing:* All pages were tested regularly to make sure the would work on different size screens.

The approach to the site is to cover all the things a prospective customer would want. I have asked other people for their opinions and taken advice on what they would require.
I have made sure that all basic needs are covered and kept it as simple and easy to follow as I could. 

I tested the output on Edge and Chrome and both worked without issues.
