# Milestone Project 1



## CC Fitness. 
The aim of the website is to advertise CC Fitness to prospective clients and to sell the company in the local area.  It is arranged in 4 different pages using links in the header.



### UX

The site is for anyone who is interested in employing a personal trainer and to show the variety of exercises that are available to anyone and everyone. 
It will show a few testimonials the company have received from current clients and the various goals each person is able to achieve. 
There will also be video evidence of some of the activities that you can expect to perform in. 
There is also a short biog of the trainer giving his qualifications and experience.
Finally, there will be an activity list with prices including a discount price for booking 10 sessions in advance.
The initial template for the site was built on a wireframe using Balsamiq the pdf folder is here  
This template was changed as the project progressed, but the basics are the same. 



### Features

Each page tells a different story. 

- *Home Page:* Shows a strong headline with a mission statement. This is meant to draw the user in. there is a backdrop of a park with a runner which will show that this is an activity 
               that can be performed outdoors as well as in a gym. There is also a list of testimonials given by current clients. 

- *Videos:* This page will have a number of videos showing the sort of exercise that is available and will cover the different types of age and experience the trainer will cover. 

- *About:* A short description showing the experience and qualifications of the trainer. It will also show his enthusiasm and dedication. 

- *Prices:* The final page will show the available sessions and the prices per hour for each class. This includes a discount for long term booking.

- *Sign up:* Each page has a Sign Up button which points to a Modal asking for a Name, e-mail address and which type of course the user is interested in. 
             When the site is up and running this will be linked to the company e-mail ready to be answered. Each section is set up with a required field so the customer must fill in all details correctly. 



### Technologies Used

- *Wireframe:* The initial framework was built using Wireframe, this was uodated and altered where necessary as the project moved forward.

- *HTML:* The Project used HTML as its main language for the website

- *CSS:* CSS was used for styling the HTML part of the project.

### Testing

During the project various components were tested, where required. 

- *Navigation Bar:* The Navbar was tested to ensure the user was able to move between pages as required.

- *Videos:* All the videos were set up to work on a loop once they were activated. This was tested after every video was installed and resized.

- *Sign Up Button:* The sign up button was tested on every page and made sure that all the entries were required to be filled out and an error message appears if they are not.

- *Sizing:* All pages were tested regularly to make sure the would work on different size screens.
